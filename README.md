# Simon_Speck_Ciphers_C_Algorithm
A project mostly with Simon Cipher C code.

simon_ABCD is just test for x=4142 and y=4344.

simon_123_text need 123text to cipher and plain, and the cipher results of 4142 4344 is same with simon_ABCD, but it is different with Simon_Speck_Ciphers by inmcm when plaintext is 6565 6877.

speck_test is directly from Zhiqian Hao, so it doesn't under test.
