# Simon_Speck_Ciphers_erro
A project mostly with Simon Cipher C code.

simon_ABCD is just suitable for x=4142 and y=4344.

simon_123text_error has 123text to cipher and plain, but the cipher results is different with simon_ABCD even the plain result is right. So there are some errors in simon_123text_error.
